# Purpose

The Purpose of this project is to provide the api to connect to HipChat.

# Design

I hoping that the design of the API will be good for creating many tools, but 
in particular the set of command line utilites to enable "Chat Operations" type
work. This would be things like a bot that can give you status on currently 
running systems. Tail the contents of a log file, into a the chat window.
